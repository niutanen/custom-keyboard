### Keyboard layout creator for Corne split keyboard 
This was a small project to build a split keyboard for a friend. 

In essence this was a simple assembly capped off with a pretty self-guiding tutorial that I followed on https://zmk.dev/docs/features/split-keyboards
Once I got a basic functional configuration flashed onto the keyboard, i passed it on to the friend so that they could tinker with it. To my knowledge it is still in use today.
